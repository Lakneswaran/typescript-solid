# Solid principles

## Solid Design Principles

Group of ObjectOriental principles => A developer can use with this principles Readable, Maintainable and write clean code.



## SRP => Single Responsibility Principles
## OCP => Open Closed Principles
## LSP => Liskov substitution Principles
## ISP => Interface Segregation Principles
## DIP => Dependency Inversion Principles

## SRP

- A class should have one and only or reason to change :exclamation:


## OCP

- Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. :exclamation:

- Class closed for modification, open for extension new classes can be added to use for the module, 
  but the module should be untouched.

## LSP

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base type.

### What is Polymorphism :question:

- We using one block of code and changing which version of block of code we using depending on the input we giving it.

## ISP

- Spilt the interface as much possible for to can be used by the different types of objects :exclamation:

- The dependency of one close to another one should depend on the smallest possible interface.

- Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.

- Instead of one fat interface many small interface are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one         submodule.

## DIP

- Depend upon abstractions (Interfaces) not upon concrete classes :exclamation:
